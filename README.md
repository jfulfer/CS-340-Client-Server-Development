## Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs
When writing programs like the CRUD Python module for the dashboard, I tried to keep things simple, clean, and organized. I made sure to use clear names for functions and variables so it would be easy to understand what everything was doing. I also kept the code broken up into small chunks instead of having long, messy sections. Adding comments here and there helped too, especially for parts that might not be obvious later on.

Working like this made a big difference. It kept the database code separate from the dashboard code, so it was easier to build and fix things without getting confused. One of the best parts is that I can reuse the CRUD module for future projects just by tweaking it a little bit. I wouldn’t have to start over every time. It saves a ton of time and makes updates way easier.

## How I Approach Problems as a Computer Scientist
When it came to the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I started by really trying to understand what was needed — basically, what kind of data we were dealing with and what the client wanted to see. From there, I broke the project into smaller steps, like setting up the database, writing the queries, and building the dashboard piece by piece.

This project was different from past assignments because I spent more time planning before I started coding. In earlier classes, I used to just dive in and figure things out as I went, but for this one, I realized planning ahead saved a lot of headaches later. Going forward, I definitely want to stick to that approach — take a little extra time up front to break the project down and make sure I really understand the client’s needs before I start writing anything.

## What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists basically solve problems using technology. It could be by building programs, working with data, creating apps, or even designing systems for businesses. It matters because a lot of companies (and people) depend on technology to make their work easier, faster, and more accurate.

With a project like this, the dashboard and database would help a company like Grazioso Salvare organize their data and find important information quickly. Instead of wasting time digging through files, they could use the dashboard to get what they need in just a few clicks. That means they can focus more on helping animals instead of fighting with their technology, which in the end helps them do their job better.
